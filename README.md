# NEOWiki
A website that lets you make a wallet, look at community art and the latest NEO news, basicaly a fun wikipedia that's beautiful and educates people about NEO.

## Things to be done :

 Need to re-design home page and add some more life to it, looks to blocky and bad - especcialy adding a new chart and graph showing NEO price and stats. Need to smooth and polish everything up and finish up the community art page then work on the News page. 
Update: I made a list containing information about NEO, but can't get it to display on the news.html webpage. Anyone willing to fix it please do!

New page : Support Page where people can read about problems in the past, see FAQ answers, and submit a request to get help.


~~Need to add capability to search blocks, addresses, transactions in a very stlyish and easy to use way~~ - may or may not do this, least important.
