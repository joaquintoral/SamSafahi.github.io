NEO website that lets you make a wallet, search blocks etc, and look at community art and the latest NEO news, basicaly a fun encyclopedia that's beatiful.


New NEO website project I'm working on, planning on adding a new page called "news" where it shows the latest news about NEO. Need to make everything smooth and work together and make the color scheme green. I added a page called "posters" that I will use to display NEO artwork , but I may rename the page to "art" or something like that. Please feel free to add and contribute, there's lots to be done!
