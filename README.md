NEOWiki website that lets you make a wallet, search blocks etc, and look at community art and the latest NEO news, basicaly a fun encyclopedia that's beautiful and educates people about NEO.

Things to be done :

Need to add capability to search blocks, addresses, transactions in a very stlyish and easy to use way. Need to re-design home page and add some more life to it, looks to blocky and bad. Need to smooth and polish everything up and finish up the community art page then work on the News page. I was thinking of a script that automatically posted news tweeted from @neonewstoday or something like that. 

New page : Support Page where people can read about problems in the past, see FAQ answers, and submit a request to get help.
